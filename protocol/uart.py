    '''Decode a UART data stream

    This is a generator function that can be used in a pipeline of waveform
    procesing operations.
    
    stream
        A stream of 2-tuples of (time, value) pairs. The type of stream is identified
        by the stream_type parameter. Either a series of real valued samples that will
        be analyzed to find edge transitions or a set of pre-processed edge transitions
        representing the 0 and 1 logic states of the UART waveform. When this is a sample
        stream, an initial block of data is consumed to determine the most likely logic
        levels in the signal.
    
    bits
        The number of bits in each word. Typically 5, 7, 8, or 9.
    
    parity
        The type of parity to use. One of None, 'even', or 'odd'
    
    stop_bits
        The number of stop bits. Typically 1, 1.5, or 2
    
    lsb_first
        Boolean indicating whether the Least Significant Bit is transmitted first.
    
    inverted
        Boolean indicating if the signal levels have been inverted from their logical
        meaning. Use this when the input stream derives from an inverting driver such
        as those used for RS-232.
    
    baud_rate
        The baud rate of the stream. If None, the first 50 edges will be analyzed to
        automatically determine the most likely baud rate for the stream
    
    use_std_baud
        Boolean that forces coercion of automatically detected baud rate to the set of
        standard rates
    
    stream_type
        A StreamType value indicating that the stream parameter represents either Samples
        or Edges
        
    baud_deque
        An optional collections.deque object that is used to monitor the results of
        automatic baud detection. A dict containing the internal variables baud_rate
        and raw_symbol_rate is placed on the deque when uart_decode() is called.

        
    Yields a series of UartFrame objects. Each frame contains subrecords marking the location
      of sub-elements within the frame (start, data, parity, stop). Parity errors are recorded
      as an error status in the parity subrecord.
      
    Raises StreamError if stream_type = Samples and the logic levels cannot
      be determined. Also if auto-baud is active and the baud rate cannot
      be determined.
      
    Raises ValueError is the parity argument is invalid.
