    This algorithm works well for real world data sets where the histogram peaks are
    normally distributed (i.e. there is some noise present in the data set).
    For synthetic waveforms lacking noise or any intermediate samples between discrete
    logic levels, the statistical measures used to determine the threshold for a peak
    are not valid. The threshold t2 ends up being too large and valid peaks may be
    excluded. To avoid this problem the histogram can be samples from a KDE instead.
