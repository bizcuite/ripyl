    This is a generator function that can be used in a pipeline of waveform
    processing operations.
    
    The clk, mosi, and cs parameters are edge or sample streams.
    Each is a stream of 2-tuples of (time, value) pairs. The type of stream is identified
    by the stream_type parameter. Either a series of real valued samples that will be
    analyzed to find edge transitions or a set of pre-processed edge transitions
    representing the 0 and 1 logic states of the waveforms. When this is a sample
    stream, an initial block of data on the clk stream is consumed to determine the most
    likely logic levels in the signal.
    
    clk
        SPI clk stream
    
    mosi
        SPI MOSI stream. The MISO signal can also be substituted here.
    
    cs
        SPI chip select stream. Can be None if cs is not available.
    
    cpol
        Clock polarity: 0 or 1
    
    cpha
        Clock phase: 0 or 1
    
    lsb_first
        Boolean indicating whether the Least Significant Bit is transmitted first.
    
    stream_type
        A StreamType value indicating that the clk, mosi, and cs parameters represent either Samples
        or Edges

    Yields a series of SpiFrame objects.
      
    Raises StreamError if stream_type = Samples and the logic levels cannot
      be determined.
