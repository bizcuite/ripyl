    '''Decode a UART data stream

    This is a generator function that can be used in a pipeline of waveform
    procesing operations.
    
    stream (sequence of (float, number) pairs)
        A stream of 2-tuples of (time, value) pairs. The type of stream is identified
        by the stream_type parameter. Either a series of real valued samples that will
        be analyzed to find edge transitions or a set of pre-processed edge transitions
        representing the 0 and 1 logic states of the UART waveform. When this is a sample
        stream, an initial block of data is consumed to determine the most likely logic
        levels in the signal.
    
    bits (int)
        The number of bits in each word. Typically 5, 7, 8, or 9.
    
    parity (string or None)
        The type of parity to use. One of None, 'even', or 'odd'
    
    stop_bits (number)
        The number of stop bits. Typically 1, 1.5, or 2
    
    lsb_first (bool)
        Flag indicating whether the Least Significant Bit is transmitted first.
    
    inverted (bool)
        Flag indicating if the signal levels have been inverted from their logical
        meaning. Use this when the input stream derives from an inverting driver such
        as those used for RS-232.
    polarity (UARTConfig)
        Set the polarity (idle state high or low).
    
    baud_rate (int)
        The baud rate of the stream. If None, the first 50 edges will be analyzed to
        automatically determine the most likely baud rate for the stream. On average
        50 edges will occur after 11 frames have been captured.
    
    use_std_baud (bool)
        Flag that forces coercion of automatically detected baud rate to the set of
        standard rates
        
    logic_levels ((float, float) or None)
        Optional pair that indicates (low, high) logic levels of the sample
        stream. When present, auto level detection is disabled. This has no effect on
        edge streams.
    
    stream_type (streaming.StreamType)
        A StreamType value indicating that the stream parameter represents either Samples
        or Edges
        
    baud_deque (collections.deque or None)
        An optional collections.deque object that is used to monitor the results of
        automatic baud detection. A dict containing the internal variables baud_rate
        and raw_symbol_rate is placed on the deque when uart_decode() is called.

        
    Yields a series of UARTFrame objects. Each frame contains subrecords marking the location
      of sub-elements within the frame (start, data, parity, stop). Parity errors are recorded
      as an error status in the parity subrecord. BRK conditions are reported as a data value
      0x00 with a framing error in the status code.
      
    Raises AutoLevelError if stream_type = Samples and the logic levels cannot
      be determined.
      
    Raises AutoBaudError if auto-baud is active and the baud rate cannot
      be determined.
      
    Raises ValueError if the parity argument is invalid.

    This function simulates a single, unidirectional channel of a UART serial

        The type of parity to use. One of None, 'even', or 'odd'

    idle_end (float)
        The amount of idle time after the transmission of data ends

        The amount of time between data words

    Yields a series of 2-tuples (time, value) representing the time and
      logic value (0 or 1) for each edge transition on txd. The first tuple
      yielded is the initial state of the waveform. All remaining
