class Enum(object):
    '''Base class for enumeration classes
    
    This provides a name() class method that will return the string
    attribute name for an encoded enumeration value.
    
    e.g.
    
    >>> class Colors(Enum):
    ...     blue = 1
    ...     red = 2
    ...     green = 3
        
    >>> Colors.name(Colors.red)
    'red'
    
    >>> Colors.name(1, True)
    'Colors.blue'

    "Instantiating" the enum class calls the name() method as well:
    
    >>> Colors(3, True)
    'Colors.green'
    
    If necesssary you can use non-integers as the values as long as they are hashable:
    
    >>> class MathConst(Enum):
    ...     pi = 3.2     # in certain US states :)
    ...     e = 2.71828
        
    >>> MathConst.pi
    3.2
