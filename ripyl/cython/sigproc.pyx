    '''Simulate an RC filter on a waveform::

    Warning: This function becomes unstable for small time constants (C * R).
    It is implemented with a simple application of the RC difference equations.
    The time step (dt) is taken from the sample period of each sample chunk divided
    by the number of iterations. The results will be inaccurate for large values of
    dt but still largely representative of the expected behavior.

    This is a generator function.

    samples (iterable of SampleChunk objects)
        An iterable sample stream to modify.

    capacitance (float)
        The capacitance value

    resistance (float)
        The resistance value

    iterations (int)
        The number of iterations to calculate each sample. You can experience numeric
        instability if this value is too low.
    
    Yields a sample stream.
