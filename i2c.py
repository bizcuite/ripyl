    sda
        An iterable representing the I2C serial data
    
    stream_type
        Indicates the type of stream used for scl and sda.
        
        When StreamType.Samples, the iterators represent a sequence of samples.
        Each sample is a 2-tuple representing the time of the sample and the sample's
        value. When this type is used, the scl stream is analyzed to determine the
        logic levels of the two streams.
        
        When StreamType.Edges, the iterators represent a series of edges.
        scl and sda are iterables of 2-tuples representing each edge transition.
        The 2-tuples *must* be in the absolute time form (time, logic level).

    
    Yields a series of StreamRecord-based objects. These will be one of three event types
    or two data types. The three events are represented by StreamEvent object with these
    obj.kind attributes:
        * 'I2C start'   The start of an I2C transfer
        * 'I2C restart' A start condition during a transfer
        * 'I2C stop'    The end of a transfer
        
    The two data types are represented by the objects I2cAddress and I2cByte. The former
    is a 7-bit or 10-bit address from the start of a transfer or restart. The latter contains
    the data read or written during the transfer. I2cByte has an attribute ack_bit that
    records the value of the ACK for that byte. I2cAddress has a r_wn attribute that indicates
    if the transfer is a read or write. The subrecords attribute contains the I2cByte object
    or objects that composed the address.
    
    Raises StreamError when the stream_type is Samples and the logic levels cannot
    be determined automatically.
